# JSON Image Downloader

## Summary
This web app automates the process of downloading images from URLs provided in a JSON file. Instead of manually clicking each URL and downloading the images one by one, users can simply upload or paste a JSON, and the app will extract unique image URLs and allow them to download all images at once in a ZIP file.

## Languages and Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **Streamlit**
- **Requests**
- **Zipfile**

## Key Learnings
- Gained experience in building a user-friendly web interface with Streamlit.
- Enhanced my skills in handling and processing JSON data.
- Learned how to automate repetitive tasks for non-technical users, improving efficiency and reducing the manual workload.

## Challenges Overcame
- Designing a simple yet effective user interface that is intuitive for non-technical users.
- Ensuring the image download process works seamlessly for various URLs, handling edge cases like broken links or failed downloads.

## Additional Reflections
This project was particularly useful for addressing a common problem in the content team at my company, where non-technical colleagues had to manually download images from a Google Sheet. By automating this process, the team can now save time and avoid tedious tasks. It also highlighted the importance of building tools that make technical processes accessible to non-technical users.
